What is:
 - like a factory, but everyhting is encapsulated

    - method that orders the object
    - factories that build the object
    - final objects
    - final objects contain objects that use the Strtegy Pattern
        - Composition: Object class fields are objects

 - Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
 - Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime
 - You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects interact through common interfaces
 - Bad: Things can get complicated
